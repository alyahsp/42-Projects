# FDF

FDF is a 42 Project taking a map as parameter and creating its 3d representation.

* Create a 3d representation of a map using vectors and matrix.
* You can rotate, translate and zoom/dezoom.
* Colors of the map altermate according to seasons.
* Thanks to my dear friend <a href="http://www.github.com/Janwalsh91">Janwalsh91</a> for the miscellaneous tips and the awesome colors.
